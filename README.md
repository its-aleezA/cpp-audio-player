# üéµ C++ Audio Player

This is a Windows-based console audio player written in C++. It allows users to browse local music directories, create and manage playlists, shuffle songs, and keep track of recently played tracks ‚Äî all while demonstrating key data structures like doubly linked lists and queues.

A simple **HTML/CSS/JavaScript GUI** has also been added to visualize the functionalities with a user-friendly interface.

## üåê Graphical Interface

A simple browser-based GUI has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simulate how the audio player works in a graphical environment.  
This is a **static visual interface** and does not yet integrate directly with the C++ backend.

To try it out:
1. Open `gui/index.html` in any browser.
2. Browse the mock interface and explore playlist functionalities visually.
